But what society and church so desperately need are men who embrace all that God created them to be, who long to follow God without limits and meet the needs of those around them without hesitation. To get there, we need what Pastor James MacDonald calls “radical surgery”—a deep, probing exploration and reparation of all that it means to be a man. In his definitive, bold voice, MacDonald calls men to be watchful, firm in their faith, strong, and loving. This isn’t a call for bravado and bluster. It’s a call for men to mix tender and tough, to be humble, to follow Jesus. It is a call to be leaders, men of God, husbands who are present and caring and strong. It is straight talk—no posturing or posing or beating around the bush—inviting men to redemption and restoration in their manhood.

In this informative and prophetically stirring book, Perry Stone answers these questions and more as he details a large-scale picture of what will occur in the time of the end.
Revealing the plan of God evident from the beginning of time, Stone identifies:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;?? Six major empires that have risen on the world scene and then faded into the fog of history&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;?? The seventh empire that will exist for a short period, followed by the eighth and final empire, identified as the kingdom of the beast&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;?? The link between biblical prophecies and Islamic traditions that point to the rise of this coming eighth kingdom, and a final global dictator who will seize the world&lt;/li&gt;
