			<p>Next  Scenes is a web-based content development system that aims to develop a content  from a pool of ideas contributed by various creative minds. The platform  attempts to provide forums for latent creative writers who may not otherwise be  able to write a full book on their own. By expressing their views on story  lines through the contributions of Story Bursts, potential writers are able to  release all their latent creative energies and Nextscenes will harness the  products of the world’s best creative minds into very compelling reading  materials.<br />
              <strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong><br />
All  Contributors, the Power Users, are required to participate under a pseudonym.  The ultimate goal is to compile books from the best inputs from these different  sources: inputs with the most compelling contents. The successful Contributors  will also benefit from the sales of the books when they are eventually  published but in proportion to their contributions.<br />
