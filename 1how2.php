			<p class="testimonial2">The  Moderator will provide a topic or theme for any particular Genre or Forum. The  details of the topic will set out the storyline and members of the public will  determine how the storyline will develop.</p>

			

			<p class="testimonial2">The  topic will be live online for all Users and Power Users to view but only Power  Users will contribute to the storyline.</p>
			


		  <p class="testimonial2">A  Power User will be expected to read the previous materials and propose a  &ldquo;Burst&rdquo; that will constitute a possible sequence to the previous scene but will  still blend into the entire storyline line.</p>
			

		  <p class="testimonial2">Each  &ldquo;Burst&rdquo; should not be more than 500 words.</p>
			

		  <p class="testimonial2">All  subscribers will be able to rate each &ldquo;Burst&rdquo; on the scale of 1 to 10.</p>
		

			<p class="testimonial2">The  &ldquo;Bursts&rdquo; with the highest ratings will be adopted for the storyline on a &ldquo; the first  received, the first to be adopted&rdquo; rule.</p>


<p class="testimonial2">When  a particular scene has been completed, it will form completed part of the storyline  and the next scene will become active to receive submissions.</p>

<p class="testimonial2">And  so on, and so forth, &hellip;.</p>

<p class="testimonial2">At  the instance of the Moderator, the collected materials will be grouped in  chapters, etc.</p>

<p class="testimonial2">The  Moderator will determine the point at which the story will end.</p>

<p class="testimonial2">At  the end of the exercise, the materials will be edited by professional editors and  published as eBook or physical books.</p>

<p class="testimonial2">All  recognized contributors to the final materials used for the book will be  compensated from the proceeds of the sale of the books according to the  previously laid down rules. </p>
